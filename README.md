**A lightweight i3-style application switcher for macOS that preserves your native workflow**

CmdN brings the simplicity and efficiency of i3-style keyboard shortcuts to macOS without compromising your native Mac experience. Switch to any application instantly with a single keystroke while keeping all your familiar Mission Control features intact.

## Why CmdN?

**Native Integration**: Unlike heavyweight alternatives, CmdN uses only standard macOS APIs and plays perfectly with Mission Control, Spaces, and three-finger swipe gestures.

**Instant Access**: Press `Cmd+<number>` to switch to any application instantly. No complex keychords or muscle memory retraining required.

**Zero Compromise**: Keep all your Mac workflows while gaining the productivity benefits of keyboard-driven application switching.

## Comparison with Alternatives

**CmdN vs. Aerospace**
- **Mission Control Compatibility**: Aerospace forces all windows into a single desktop, breaking macOS Spaces and three-finger swipe navigation. CmdN preserves your native workflow completely.
- **Learning Curve**: Both offer fast switching, but CmdN works with your existing Mac habits rather than replacing them.

**CmdN vs. Yabai**
- **System Requirements**: Yabai requires disabling System Integrity Protection (SIP) for Mission Control features, compromising system security. CmdN uses only standard APIs with no system modifications required.
- **Complexity**: Yabai is a full tiling window manager with extensive configuration. CmdN focuses purely on fast application switching with minimal setup.

**CmdN vs. rcmd**
- **Key Ergonomics**: rcmd uses the right Command key exclusively, forcing users to adapt their muscle memory. CmdN supports both left and right Command keys, letting you keep your natural typing habits.
- **Accessibility**: Both are lightweight, but CmdN is open source and free.

**CmdN vs. Assignee**
- **Speed**: Assignee requires a keychord (prefix key + app key), adding an extra step. CmdN uses a single keystroke (`Cmd+<number>`) for immediate switching.
- **Simplicity**: CmdN's approach is more direct and requires less cognitive overhead during rapid task switching.

**Why Choose CmdN?**
- **Native Integration**: Works seamlessly with Mission Control, Spaces, and all macOS gestures
- **Zero Compromise**: Enhances your workflow without replacing familiar behaviors
- **Lightweight**: Extremely minimal resource usage with standard API compliance
- **Open & Free**: Complete transparency with no licensing costs
- **Ergonomic**: Respects your existing muscle memory and typing habits

*CmdN's Philosophy*: Enhance your Mac experience without replacing it. We believe the best tools are invisible until you need them.

## Known Issues

**Accessibility Features Restart Required**
After enabling accessibility permissions in System Preferences, CmdN requires a manual restart to activate these features. Currently, there's no in-app restart option‚Äîsimply quit CmdN from the menu bar and relaunch it to gain access to accessibility-related functionality.

**Desktop Switching Conflicts**
Occasionally, CmdN may switch to an empty desktop instead of the intended application. This typically occurs when:
- The target application is in fullscreen mode (try unfullscreening and re-fullscreening the app)
- Empty numbered desktops exist in Mission Control, which can create conflicts with macOS's built-in desktop switching shortcuts

*Workaround*: Ensure your numbered desktops in Mission Control are populated with applications, or consider adjusting your keyboard shortcuts to avoid conflicts with system shortcuts.
